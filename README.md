# Exploratory-Data-Dashboard
This dashboard was an exploratory analysis using data from past Olympic Games. 
<br>
The user is able to identify what medals were received by specific individuals in any given year, and also determine what specific event, and type of medal were received. This project is a show case on my knowledge with Power BI, and data visualization.
